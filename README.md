## About

User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project One 

This website is designed as a beginner friendly guide for Investing. Aimed at getting complete novices to start understanding money and what steps to start taking in order to invest in the stock markets.


## UX

The focus is to get content out to the end user. The end user should have an easy to use website to be guided towards different types of material which will then help guide them towards real life investing. 

In order for the website to provide value to the end user the content would need to be easy to understand and not jargon.
